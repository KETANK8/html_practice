<dt><b>Russia withdrawing troops from Kherson, but Ukrainian authorities skeptical
</b></dt>
<dd style="color:#c0c0c0"><br>Russia’s military said Wednesday it will withdraw from the only Ukrainian regional capital it captured, but Kyiv was skeptical and an analyst warned this could be a ruse to lure the country’s forces into a deadly trap. A forced pullout from the city of Kherson would mark one of Russia’s worst setbacks in the 8-month-old war. <br><br> -@Ketan Kumar</dd>

<dt><b>"Kaha Chupna Hai Field Mein...": Ex-India Player On Rohit Sharma's Captaincy Decisions At T20 World Cup</b></dt>
<dd style="color:#c0c0c0"><br>"You are seeing two levels of cricket. You can't blame the captaincy, there is the team management too. Not one decision was taken by Rohit Sharma. Sirf Rohit Sharma ko khud kaha chupna hai field mein, woh unhone khud socha hoga (Where to hide on the field, Rohit Sharma would have taken that decision on his own). It's time that a non-playing captain does the job in T20s, just like in tennis. I think MS Dhoni should be made the non-playing captain of the Indian team," Atul Wassan, who played four Tests and nine ODIs, said on ABP Live. <br><br> -@Ketan Kumar</dd>

<dt><b>Google may soon allow users to convert ChromeOS screen recording into gifs
</b></dt>
<dd style="color:#c0c0c0"><br>According to a report by 9to5Google, the ChromeOS team is exploring the possibility of adding support for GIF recordings. The GIF-animated image format has been around for a long time now and is easier to share as they are supported by almost all apps and devices.
<br><br> The only disadvantage of using GIF, instead of WebM to save screen recordings on ChromeOS will be the size of the file (GIF creates larger files). However, for short recordings, this could be an appropriate tradeoff for convenience.<br><br> -@Ketan Kumar</dd>
